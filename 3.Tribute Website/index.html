                        <b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam </b>15 October 1931 - 27 July 2015 was an
                        Indian
                        aerospace scientist who served as the 11th president of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and
                        raised in
                        Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace engineering. He spent the next four
                        decades
                        as a
                        scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development Organisation
                        (DRDO) and
                        Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space
                        programme
                        and
                        military missile development efforts.[1] He thus came to be known as the Missile Man of India
                        for
                        his work
                        on
                        the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.[2][3][4] He also played a
                        pivotal
                        organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the
                        first
                        since
                        the
                        original nuclear test by India in 1974.
